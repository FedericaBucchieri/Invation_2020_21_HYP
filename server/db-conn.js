MuseX combines the features of interactive technologies and multi sensory experiences. It uses technologies such as projectors, smart objects, body movement recognition technologies and smart lights. Other than exploring the museum and its dioramas, three mini game are available. Children can deal with rock categorization to make a volcano erupt, habitat recognition working in team to beat the rivals and guessing the correct specie of bird collaborating to catch the right bird.",

You need to cut them, usually in a specific direction indicated by an arrow, to score points. To facilitate this, your VR controllers become red and blue neon sabers, which you must swing at the corresponding coloured boxes. Though there’s no official Star Wars licensing, you can’t help but feel like a Jedi Knight brandishing two lightsabers.

You can't eat meat, but you can eat grass and never forget to use your horns. At surface level, it makes for harmless puzzling fun. Danger Goat is an early example of how intuitive the Daydream controller really is, allowing for an accessible point and click experience that anyone could get to grips with, even if it’s necessary to recenter your view after every level. The worlds are colorful and inviting, too, though this is one mobile VR experience in which I really missed positional tracking, as I couldn’t lean down further into these worlds and at times the camera didn’t get close enough to the action. In fact, generally speaking, there really isn’t any reason for Danger Goat to be in VR. How far can you reach? Be the new G.O.A.T.",
    more:
      "Don’t be fooled by the bright and pleasant environments; danger lurks at every turn. For the most part, Danger Goat‘s traps will involve you accidentally walking onto a marked tile and subsequently watching your goat get obliterated. Later levels introduce a few other concepts like switches that activate gates and weapons, or rivers that carry you downstream, but the basic threats don’t really change until the final seven challenges. You’ll quickly learn that many of the traps laid out in a level are nothing more than red herrings. They’re there to trick you into tossing a boulder on them to crush them, when really you needed the rock to cross a canyon. Slip up and you’ll have to start the level from scratch if you want a three star rating. But with Danger Goat‘s love of deception established so early on, you’ll find you never really fall for the perils it lays down in its first 25 levels or so. Every time I saw a trap in front of me I’d scan the environment and quickly find a way round it. That’s what you’re meant to do, of course, but I was going through levels with such ease I started to wonder what the point in it was. What makes this even more frustrating is that the final three levels bring together the game’s mechanics for some truly challenging trials. They genuinely stumped me for some time and had me going round in circles and I really enjoyed systematically solving them. If the game had reached this point, say, halfway in and not spent so much time coddling the player this would be a very different review.",

Even the act of healing is gross, as you insert a glass cylinder containing a living alien grub into a wall-mounted health station and watch as it's crushed into a bilious liquid just inches from your face, followed by skittering needles jabbing into the backs of your fingers as the machine knits health back into your veins. Not to mention the lengthy stealth sequence where you are stalked by a creature who insta-kills me by vomiting gallons of black slime directly onto your face.
