Our goal is to bring a fully interactive museum inside a school, where teachers can bring their students in a totally save an engaging environment. MuseX combines the features of interactive technologies and multi sensory experiences. It uses technologies such as projectors, smart objects, body movement recognition technologies and smart lights. Other than exploring the museum and its dioramas, three mini game are available. Children can deal with rock categorization to make a volcano erupt, habitat recognition working in team to beat the rivals and guessing the correct specie of bird collaborating to catch the right bird.',

      'All those activities are designed to improve self-movement recognition, ability to work in group, reasoning skills and test contents learning. MuseX has a full body interaction paradigm with drag &amp; drop, RFID reader, walk around interaction and posting gesture recognition. The Magic Room provides both audible and visual feedback that enrich MuseX experience and all the activities can be managed by the teacher using a dedicated app.',

Like many of Vault-Tec’s underground bunkers, Bethesda’s multiplayer riff on its post-nuclear RPG series is an experiment gone awry. There are bright spots entangled in this mass of frustratingly buggy and sometimes conflicting systems, but what fun I was able to salvage from the expansive but underpopulated West Virginia map was consistently overshadowed by the monotony of its gathering and crafting treadmill.\nOn the surface, Fallout 76 is another dose of Bethesda’s tried-and-true open-world RPG formula on a larger-than-ever map that’s begging to be explored. As you emerge from Vault 76 you’ll start in a relatively peaceful forest and venture out into more dangerous pockets of the irradiated wasteland. My favorite is traveling the lengths of the Cranberry Bog, where the pinkish-red fields are seemingly inviting from afar but turn out to be full of a snaking system of trenches and alien forests that hide the worst horrors of the wasteland, but there are many more.',
