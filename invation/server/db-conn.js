      'In a smart interactive multi-sensory room, children can play, socialize, learn and test their knowledge about mammals, birds and geology. Our goal is to bring a fully interactive museum inside a school, where teachers can bring their students in a totally save an engaging environment. MuseX combines the features of interactive technologies and multi sensory experiences. It uses technologies such as projectors, smart objects, body movement recognition technologies and smart lights. Other than exploring the museum and its dioramas, three mini game are available. Children can deal with rock categorization to make a volcano erupt, habitat recognition working in team to beat the rivals and guessing the correct specie of bird collaborating to catch the right bird.',
    more:
      'All those activities are designed to improve self-movement recognition, ability to work in group, reasoning skills and test contents learning. MuseX has a full body interaction paradigm with drag &amp; drop, RFID reader, walk around interaction and posting gesture recognition. The Magic Room provides both audible and visual feedback that enrich MuseX experience and all the activities can be managed by the teacher using a dedicated app.',

      'The result is a “Magic Room” where children are exposed to multisensory stimuli and can interact with physical materials and multimedia contents through movements, gestures, and manipulation of objects. Magika allows to perform playful and educational activities (individual or collective) that stimulate all senses and are engaging. Compared to traditional multi-sensory rooms like Snoezelen, the playful-educational experiences in the Magic Room have greater potential for children with cognitive disabilities because they are more customizable, stimulating and engaging.',

      'Through a tablet, teachers can control and configure each activity and personalize the experience according to the specific needs of children. Magika can be controlled and configured through a tablet. Thanks to an easy and intuitive control panel, the teacher can monitor, select, and improve the activities of the room. It takes just a few steps to choose activities and to keep an eye on what’s happening. Through the tablet you can start or end the activity any time, thus teachers can manage children inside the room better.',

Emoty does not act as a virtual assistant for daily life support but aims at helping people with NDD to develop better emotional control and self-awareness, which would lead them to enhance their communication capabilities and consequently to improve their quality of life. Emoty exploits conversational technologies, Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques for emotion recognition from the text and the voice based on the processing of user’s audio pitch.',

Puffy has a combination of features which makes it unique with respect to existing robots for this target group. Puffy is mobile and its egg-shaped body is inflatable and soft. Puffy can interpret children's gestures and movements, facial expressions and emotions. It communicates using voice, lights, movements in space, as well as inside-out projections in its body.",
